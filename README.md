# Udacity-Travel-App

This is the final project that I built for the *Front-End Developer* nanodegree with Udacity.

## Features
Through this app you can:
- Choose the city of departure
- Choose the destination
- Choose a date to leave
- Print the trip details
- Delete the trip
- See a countdown that reminds you how much time is left before departure

More features will be added, so the app is continuously under construction.

## Tools
To build the *Travel App* I've used:
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Cors
- Webpack
- Service Workers
- Jest
- Supertest
- Babel
- Git
- JSON

Moreover, to get the trip info, like see the city and a image of destination, see the departure date, the weather and when the trip starts, I've used some APIs.

- **Name of the countries** --> API --> [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/)
- **Weather of destination** --> API --> [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/)
- **Image of destination** --> API --> [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com)

3. Run JEST testing with `npm test`
4. Run production environment building/updating dist folder with `npm run build-prod`
